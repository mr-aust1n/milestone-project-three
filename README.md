### 1. Design, Develop, and Implement

<em>1.0 Design, develop and implement a Back end for a web application using Python and a micro-framework.</em>

- ---a

<em>1.1 Design a Front end for a data-driven web application that meets accessibility guidelines, follows the principles of UX design, meets its given purpose and provides a set of user interactions.</em>

- ---a

<em>1.2 Implement custom HTML and CSS code to create a responsive full-stack application consisting of one or more HTML pages with relevant responses to user actions and a set of data manipulation functions.</em>

- ---a

<em>1.3 Build a database-backed Flask web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.</em>

- ---a

<em>1.4 Design a database structure that is relevant to the domain, including relationships between records of different entities.</em>

- ---a

<em>1.5 Design and implement test procedures (automated or manual) to assess functionality, usability, responsiveness and data management within the Full Stack web application.</em>

- ---a

<em>1.6 Write Python code that is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide (or another explicitly mentioned style guide, such as Google’s) and validated HTML and CSS code.</em>

- ---a

<em>1.7 Write Python logic to demonstrate proficiency in the language.</em>

- ---a

<em>1.8 Include functions with compound statements such as if conditions and/or loops in Python code.</em>

- ---a

<em>1.9 Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (comments, indentation, consistent and meaningful naming conventions).</em>

- ---a

<em>1.10 Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.</em>

- ---a

### 2. Model and Manage Data

<em>2.1 Design a data model that fits the purpose of the project.</em>

- ---a

<em>2.2 Develop the model into a usable relational or non-relational database where data is stored in a consistent and well-organised manner.</em>

- ---a

<em>M(vii) Describe the data schema fully in the README file.</em>

- ---a

<em>M(viii) Maintain database configuration in a single location where it can be changed easily.</em>

- ---a

<em>M(ix) Maintain a Profile, requirements.txt file, settings file.</em>

- ---a

### 3. Query and Manipulate Data

<em>3.1 Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records.</em>

- ---a

<em>M(x) Implement working Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD).</em>

- ---a

<em>M(xi) Check that Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) actions are immediately reflected in the user interface.</em>

- ---a

### 4. Deployment to a Cloud Platform

<em>4.1 Deploy a final version of the full-stack application code to a cloud-based hosting platform (e.g., Heroku) and test to ensure it matches the development version.</em>

- ---a

<em>4.2 Ensure that final deployed code is free of commented out code and has no broken internal links.</em>

- ---a

<em>4.3 Document the deployment process in a README file that also explains the application’s purpose and the value that it provides to its users.</em>

- ---a

<em>M(xii) Commit often for each individual feature/fix, ensuring that commits are small, well-defined and have clear descriptive messages.</em>

- ---a

<em>M(xiii) Fully document the deployment procedure in a section in a README file, written using consistent and effective markdown formatting that is well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors.</em>

- ---a

### 5. Identify and Apply Security Features

<em>5.1 Use Git & GitHub for version control of a Full Stack web application up to deployment, using commit messages to document the development process.</em>

- ---a

<em>5.2 Commit final code that is free of any passwords or secret keys, to the repository and to the hosting platform.</em>

- ---a

<em>5.3 Use environment variables, or files that are in gitignore, to hide all secret keys.</em>

- ---a

<em>5.4 Ensure that DEBUG mode is turned off in production versions.</em>

- ---a

<em>M(xiv) Present a clear rationale for the development of the project, in the README, demonstrating that it has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences), explaining the data, and explaining the security features considered.</em>
